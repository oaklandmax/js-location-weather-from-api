What to Build

Create the following single page application, based on the mockup attached.

- The functionality must include:
   - Responsive layout, using accessible markup and SCSS syntax (no CSS frameworks)
   - Vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks
   - Geolocation by default (with zipcode input box failover if user denies permissions)
   - "Not here?" should link to input box to correct the location
   - Request to weather API: <a href="http://openweathermap.org/api/">openweathermap.org/api/</a>
   - Current dayâ€™s forecast as mocked up (but using live data)
   - Put this on codepen.io
- Also:
 - Feel free to make any design or functional improvements you see fit
 - Zip code form should self falidate
 - Use weather icons: <a href="http://alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/">alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/</a> (Use SVG format)
